## Goal of this Issue

This special issue reflects on issues reflecting on successful (and unsuccessful) case studies about 
reproduction and replication of SE
results. Using current ACM definitions, we say:

- Artifact results  are _replicated_ when the main results glemaed from thsoe artifacts have 
been ontained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the artifact authors using, 
in parts, the _available_ artifacts (and  _available artifacts_ are 
those that are  organised and available on some publically accessible archive). 
- Artifacts are _reproduced_ when the main results gleamed from those artifacts have been 
indepedently obtained in a subsequeny study
by a person or team other than the authors, without the use of author-supplied artifacts


Submissions are requested that reflect, at least in part, on specific issues seen with specific case studies
of replication and reproduction. 

These submissions will, by definition, include some material that has been published previously.
Papers accepted to this special issue will use that material _AND_ offer a significant extension that is a reflection
on lessons learned about to achieve (or fail to achieve) replication and reproduction.

Theoretical discussions about the nature and value of replication and reproduction 
(which do not make extensive reference to case study material)
should be submitted to other venues.
