## Goal of this Issue

One key element in the open science initiatives of the empirical software engineering community is to foster transparency and replicability in our field. Using current ACM definitions, we say:

- Artifact results  are _replicated_ when the main results glemaed from thsoe artifacts have 
been ontained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the artifact authors using, 
in parts, the _available_ artifacts (and  _available artifacts_ are 
those that are  organised and available on some publically accessible archive). 
- Artifacts are _reproduced_ when the main results gleamed from those artifacts have been 
indepedently obtained in a subsequeny study
by a person or team other than the authors, without the use of author-supplied artifacts

Motivated by the experiences made in past [ROSE festivals](https://github.com/researchart/rose2-icse19/blob/master/README.md), this special issue shall take replication and reproduction in Software Engineering to the next level by inviting articles that reflect on issues emerging from the successful (and unsuccessful) case studies about reproduction and replication of SE results. In particular, we invite:
- Replication studies in SE
- Experience reports providing insights into conducted replication studies in SE
- Methodological papers reporting on issues generally related to replication studies in SE. These should ideally also refer to specific case study material if possible.

All submissions should reflect, at least in part, on specific issues seen with specific case studies of replication and reproduction as the long-term goal is to improve the notion of replication in Software Engineering based on insights shared in this special issue.

Submissions that report on replications need, by definition, to include some material that has been published previously.
Papers accepted to this special issue will use that material _AND_ offer a significant extension that is a reflection
on lessons learned about to achieve (or fail to achieve) replication and reproduction.
