# CFP, Patterns and Anti-Patterns of Replication and Reproduction in Software Engineering

## Special ISSUE Empirical Software Engineering Journal.

Editors of the Special Issue (To be confirmed)

- Tim Menzies (NC State, USA)
- Daniel Mendez (Technical University of Munich, Germany)

## Goal of this Issue

Increasingly, the authors of SE research papers are preparing "research  artifacts"
that package up the scripts and data used to make their conclusions. Many SE conferences now
make special mention of papers that come with such research packages and they are more and more encouraging the disclosure of replication packages.

This special issue asks "are such research packages usable and  useful?". Is it true that other teams can run these research packages? And is such execution "useful"; i.e. what is the scientific/practical value of
research team2 using research artifacts from team1.

More specifically, we seek

1. _Case studies_ that document the patterns and anti-patterns associated with the use of these research artifact packages.
     - Negative reports where reproduction/replication failed are of particular interest;
2. _Reflection papers_
on why and when such artifact packages are useful (or not useful).
3. _Vision statements_ about open challenges
with the use of such research packages
4.  _Tools papers_ that describe functioning tools that support the patterns and discourage anti-patterns of replication and reproduction.
5. _Critique papers_ that comment on how research artifacts are/should be classified. For example, the ACM portal supports the following definitions. Are these definitions useful? How can they be improved?
    - According [to the ACM](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging),
artifact results  are _replicated_ when the main results gleamed from those artifacts have
been contained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the artifact authors using,
in parts, the _available_ artifacts (and  _available artifacts_ are
those that are  organized and available on some publically accessible archive).
    - Further, artifacts are _reproduced_ when the main results gleamed from those artifacts have been
independently obtained in a subsequent study
by a person or team other than the authors, without the use of author-supplied artifacts

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- This special issue will be welcoming to short papers (minimum 4 pages), particularly for the case study papers.
- Submissions that report on replications need, by
definition, to include some material that has been published
previously.  Papers accepted to this special issue can use that
material _ONLY IF_ they also offer a significant extension that is a reflection
on lessons learned about to achieve (or fail to achieve) replication
and reproduction.
